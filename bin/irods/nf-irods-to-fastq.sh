  # For example: 
  # Sample ID: HCA_SkO13919076
  # Associated FASTQ files would be named as:
  # HCA_SkO13919076_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz

  #
  # Where:
  # - The filename starts with the sample ID (e.g., HCA_SkO13919076).
  # - The filenames follow the CellRanger convention, with S (sample), L (lane), R (read), and I (index) information.
