Output Data
===========

Output data generated by Solosis is stored in a standardised directory structure under the team’s Lustre folder. This structure is designed to ensure consistency and to make it easy for team members to locate and share common outputs such as CRAM and FASTQ files, or Cell Ranger results.

Any data generated by Solosis in these standard locations is automatically removed after 90 days.
